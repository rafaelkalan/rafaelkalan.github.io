## Summary
  Software developer and Computer Science student. Backend engineering enthusiastic I have worked and studied some of the most powerful languages like C ANSI / C++, PHP, Python, Java, NodeJS, solving data problems using MySQL, MongoDB, ElasticSearch and now I’m experiencing some challenges with the web front-end world working with JavaScript and its framework ecosystem. I am passionate about the Open Source and Free Software community as a whole, and I’m trying to contribute with my time and as well improve my knowledge being a more active member of the local communities in my town. As an IT lover, I spent the most part my free time working in academic, open source and personal projects, like I said before I’m a technology enthusiast so I spend a lot of time looking for opportunities to innovate over the existing markets, motivated by architecture and design challenges, focusing on learning. This way I try to achieve mine and the right company objectives.
