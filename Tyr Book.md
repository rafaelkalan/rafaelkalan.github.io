# **Tyr, God of Justice**

### The Terrible, the One-armed, Tyr the Terrible, Tyr the One-armed, the Wounded Tyr, the Crippled God, the Blind Man, the Blind Tyr, the Lord of Justice â€” all these names speak of the nature of the god of justice![Tyr](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forgottenrealms/images/2/28/Tyr.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20210429131410) 
### Tyr is a noble warrior, without a right hand, which he lost because of the brave sacrifice and with a blindfold on his eyes as a sign of blindness.

## **Tyr Creed**

>### *Follow all just laws and work to get unjust laws changed. Work against injustice everywhere, and never refuse to give aid or allow your aid to be less than wholehearted. Defend against injustice as if every wronged being is your beloved. **Be good and fair always**, exposing corruption and remaining steadfast and firm. Where laws fail, law keepers are corrupt, or rulers are cruel, capricious, or unfair, be the wise and even hand of justice. Always consider consequences rather than merely the judgment of the moment. Yet behave without pride or aggression, so secular authorities defer to you rather than feeling defied or disrespected. Guard against the twisting of laws, but show understanding and mercy rather than harsh conformity, for **all laws are imperfect**. Strive ever to make laws better. Never prejudge.*

# **Tyr Sermons**
## **Sermons one**
>  *Tyr is a jealous and avenging God; Tyr is avenging and wrathful; Tyr takes vengeance on his adversaries and keeps wrath for his enemies. Tyr is slow to anger and great in power, and Tyr will by no means clear the guilty. His way is in whirlwind and storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.*

## **Tyrrants Believes**

> *We tyrrans se the world in black-and-white morality and want the world to be cleansed of its lawlessness and chaos.*
>
> *Among us that follow Tyr's believes were judges, lawyers, magistrates, the oppressed and paladins.*
>
> *We are devoted to justice and the deliverance of vengeance, but not in a manner that search equality. Rather, we believed in illuminating the truth behind corruption and punishment of the guilty.*

>>![priestOfTyr](https://www.thievesguild.cc/5e/images/gods/pics/tyr-04.jpg)
>>
>> Priests of Tyr wore blue and purple robes, with a white sash and left-handed glove. On their right hands, priests wore black gloves to symbolize the loss of Tyr's hand
>> Many knightly orders are dedicated to Tyr, for example, the Knights of Holy Justice or the Knights of the Merciful Sword. Such knights - as well as judges and priests, clerics and paladins who worship Tyr - sometimes wear thin bandages of transparent cloth over their eyes to remind others of the blindness of justice.
